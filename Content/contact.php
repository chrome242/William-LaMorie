        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am unable to take any new clients for the 1st or
        2nd quarter of 2015, however, I am currently looking to take on new
        clients in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2015.</p>
        <p>I've an experienced full stack developer with expertise in PHP,
        SQL, JavaScript, JQuerry, HTML, and CSS. I've worked heavly with
        Twitter Bootstrap, and am confortable working from the ground up
        on dynamic, responsive sites, however I accell at modernizing flat,
        unresponsive HTML sites, building simple custom content manage
        systems from the ground up.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to branch out into using some of the more common PHP
        or Python based Frameworks in the near future, and would be willing to
        take on projects utilizing these tools at a reduved rate.</p>
        <p>Please contact me via email or Twitter if possible, and please only contact via phone if the situation is urgent.</p>
